What is Nmap-Port-Scanner?

Port Scanning is one of the features of Nmap wherein the tool detects the status of the ports on active hosts in a network. The status of the ports can be open, filtered, or closed. Type Nmap in the command line to run Nmap. Add necessary switches according to the scanning type to initiate a specific scan technique.

**Here are some benefits of Nmap-Port-Scanning:**

1.Discover hosts: Nmap can discover live hosts on a network.
2.Scan for open ports: Nmap can identify open ports and determine which services are running on those ports.
3.Discover services: Nmap can discover services on a computer network.
4.Test for vulnerabilities: Nmap can test for vulnerabilities.
5.Provide a picture of network structure: Nmap can provide a detailed picture of a network's structure and the devices connected to it.
6.Determine characteristics: Nmap can help cybersecurity professionals determine what hosts are available on a network, what services they offer, 7.what operating systems they're running, and the type of firewalls in use.
